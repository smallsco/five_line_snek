Five Line Battlesnake Challenge

From Brad and Joe's Coding Badly stream on Feb 20, 2021: Can you write a Battlesnake in 5 lines?

This is my entry. It targets food if health is < 40 and the opposing snake's head otherwise.

Doesn't work outside of 1v1 or solo play.
Doesn't do any body or edge detection so it usually dies pretty quickly. But it works and occasionally survives more than 3-4 turns!
